This project was developed as part of my data science coursework. The goal is to analyze a telecommunications dataset to predict Customer Churn—identifying which customers are likely to cancel their service. By predicting churn, a company can proactively offer incentives to retain customers.

Objectives
Perform Data Cleaning and Preparation (JSON flattening).

Explore data through visualization to find key churn drivers.

Address class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

Train and evaluate Machine Learning models (K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest).

Dataset
The dataset is provided in a nested JSON format containing:

Customer Information: Gender, seniority, partner/dependent status.

Service Details: Phone service, internet (DSL/Fiber optic), online security, etc.

Account Info: Tenure, contract type, payment method, and monthly charges.

Modeling:

Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Implemented Random Forest Classifier.

Evaluated models using Confusion Matrices and Classification Reports.
